## Titanic Survival Prediction 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning algorithms, with a focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and feature analysis.

## Dataset Information
- **Source**: Titanic dataset with passenger information
- **Size**: 891 passengers, 12 original features
- **Target**: Survival prediction (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
- **Missing Data**: Age (177), Cabin (687), Embarked (2)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Treatment**: 
  - Age: Filled with median (28.0)
  - Embarked: Filled with mode ('S')
  - Cabin: Dropped due to 77% missing values
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted titles from passenger names
  - Created FamilySize (SibSp + Parch + 1)
  - Created IsAlone indicator (FamilySize == 1)
- **Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Purpose**: Dimensionality reduction and feature importance analysis
- **Results**: 8 components explain 97.1% of data variance
- **Key Findings**:
  - PC1 (32.7%): Family-related features (FamilySize, IsAlone, SibSp)
  - PC2 (20.0%): Socio-economic features (Pclass, Fare, Age)
  - PC3 (12.7%): Personal attributes (Title, Embarked, Age)

### 3. Feature Importance Analysis
**Top Features by Correlation with Survival:**
1. Sex: 0.543 (strongest predictor)
2. Pclass: -0.338 (passenger class)
3. Fare: 0.257 (ticket fare)
4. IsAlone: -0.203 (traveling alone)
5. Embarked: -0.168 (port of embarkation)

### 4. Machine Learning Models
**Models Tested:**
- Logistic Regression (Original & PCA features)
- Random Forest (Original & PCA features)

**Performance Results:**
1. Random Forest (Original): **82.68% accuracy** ‚≠ê Best Model
2. Random Forest (PCA): 82.12% accuracy
3. Logistic Regression (Original): 81.01% accuracy
4. Logistic Regression (PCA): 81.01% accuracy

## Key Insights

### Survival Patterns
- **Overall Survival Rate**: 38.4%
- **Gender Impact**: Women: 74.2% vs Men: 18.9%
- **Class Impact**: 1st: 62.9%, 2nd: 47.3%, 3rd: 24.2%
- **Family Effect**: Passengers with family had better survival rates

### PCA Insights
- Successfully reduced 10 features to 8 components with minimal information loss
- Family relationships and socio-economic status are primary variance drivers
- PCA provides interpretable feature groupings

### Model Performance
- Random Forest outperforms Logistic Regression
- Original features slightly better than PCA-transformed features
- Feature engineering improves model performance significantly

## Technical Implementation

### Data Split
- Training: 712 samples (80%)
- Testing: 179 samples (20%)
- Stratified split to maintain class balance

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy: 82.68%
- Precision (Not Survived): 85%
- Precision (Survived): 79%
- Recall (Not Survived): 87%
- Recall (Survived): 75%
